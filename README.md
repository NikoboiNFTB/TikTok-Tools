## TikTok Auto Poster

Automatically clicks **Post Video** and **Confirm/Post Now** buttons on TikTok.  
Inspired by tristedo's video _"I Built a TikTok Bot That Posts Every Minute"_ — that failed at the very last step. I fixed the missing functionality.

### Installation

1. Install Violentmonkey (or another userscript manager) from your favorite browser extension store. (On Chromium browsers you must enable "Allow User Scripts" in the extensions settings)
2. Click [install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/TikTok-Auto-Poster/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-poster-1.0.user.js) and install when prompted.  

---

### Usage

Once installed:

The script will automatically click **Post Video** and/or **Post Now** buttons when they appear.

---

### Notes

- The script runs on all TikTok URLs (`*://*.tiktok.com/*`).
- It keeps retrying every second until the buttons are successfully clicked.
- Use responsibly — automated posting may violate TikTok’s terms of service.

*Happy posting!* 🚀
