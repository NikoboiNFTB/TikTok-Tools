Tools for TikTok

## TikTok Auto Poster

Automatically clicks **Post Video** and **Confirm/Post Now** buttons on TikTok.

Inspired by [tristedo](https://www.youtube.com/@tristefr)'s video [*I Built a TikTok Bot That Posts Every Minute*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlyAWXeGIl4) that failed at the very last step. I fixed the missing functionality.

### Installation

1. Install Violentmonkey (or another userscript manager) from your favorite browser extension store. (On Chromium browsers you must enable "Allow User Scripts" in the extensions settings)
2. Click [install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/TikTok-Tools/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-poster.user.js) and install when prompted.

### Usage

Once installed the script will automatically click **Post Video** and/or **Post Now** buttons when they appear.

### Notes

Use responsibly, automated posting may violate TikTok’s terms of service.

## TikTok Auto Scoller

Automatically scrolls the TikTok feed every second.

Inspired by [triste](https://www.youtube.com/@tristefr)'s video "[*I Watched 1M TikToks in 24 Hours*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsAKnQrYAgA)". I think I could do better.

### Installation

Same as above but click [here](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/TikTok-Tools/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-scoller.user.js) and install when prompted by Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey.

### Usage

Once installed the script will automatically scroll on the [TikTok feed page](https://www.tiktok.com/).

### Notes

The auto-scroller is currently hardware/network limited. It's fast.

Add the [blocklist](blocklist.txt) to uBlock Origin. Otherwise you have overlaying UI elements.
