Tools for TikTok

---

## TikTok Auto Poster

Automatically clicks **Post Video** and **Confirm/Post Now** buttons on TikTok.  
Inspired by [tristedo](https://www.youtube.com/@tristefr)'s video _"[I Built a TikTok Bot That Posts Every Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlyAWXeGIl4)"_ — that failed at the very last step. I fixed the missing functionality.  

### Installation

1. Install Violentmonkey (or another userscript manager) from your favorite browser extension store. (On Chromium browsers you must enable "Allow User Scripts" in the extensions settings)
2. Click [install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/TikTok-Tools/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-poster-1.0.user.js) and install when prompted.  

### Usage

Once installed:

The script will automatically click **Post Video** and/or **Post Now** buttons when they appear.


### Notes

- The script runs on all TikTok URLs (`*://*.tiktok.com/*`).
- It keeps retrying every second until the buttons are successfully clicked.
- Use responsibly — automated posting may violate TikTok’s terms of service.

*Happy posting!* 🚀

## TikTok Auto Scoller

Automatically scrolls the TikTok feed every second.  
Inspired by [triste](https://www.youtube.com/@tristefr)'s video _"[I Watched 1M TikToks in 24 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsAKnQrYAgA)"_.

### Installation

Same as above but click [here](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/TikTok-Tools/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-scoller-1.0.user.js) and install when prompted by Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey.

### Usage

Once installed:

Will automatically scroll on the [TikTok feed page](https://www.tiktok.com/).

### Notes

The auto-scroller is currently hardware/network limited.
